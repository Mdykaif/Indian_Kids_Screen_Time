# Indian_Kids_Screen_Time
The analysis reveals that Indian children are increasingly exposed to high levels of recreational screen time, particularly in the teenage group. This has led to notable health concerns and a concerning shift away from educational screen use.
# 📱 Indian Kids' Screen Time Analysis

This project explores patterns in screen time behavior among Indian children aged 8–18. The dataset consists of device usage, time spent on screens, urban vs rural differences, and associated health impacts. A combination of pivot tables and visual summaries has been used to derive meaningful insights.

## 📂 Files Included

- `Indian_Kids_Screen_Time.xlsx`: Contains the raw dataset and Sheet1 with pivot tables and analysis.
- `README.md`: Project overview and findings.
- `inferences.md`: Conclusions and observations based on data.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

- **Total Entries**: 9712 children
- **Age Range**: 8 to 18 years
- **Key Attributes**:
  - Gender
  - Avg. Daily Screen Time (in hours)
  - Primary Device Used
  - Educational-to-Recreational Screen Time Ratio
  - Urban or Rural Background
  - Reported Health Impacts

## 🔍 Analysis Highlights

- Screen time trends were analyzed with respect to **age**, **gender**, and **urban-rural** classification.
- Health impacts such as **eye strain**, **poor sleep**, and **anxiety** were observed and quantified.
- A gender distribution breakdown and age-wise screen time averages were computed.
- The ratio of **educational vs recreational use** provided insight into screen time quality, not just quantity.

## 📈 Key Questions Addressed

1. What is the correlation between age and average screen time?
2. Which age groups experience the most health issues?
3. What is the gender distribution in the dataset?
4. What devices are most commonly used by children?
5. How much of the screen time is spent on education vs recreation?

## 🧠 Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Formulas)
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib – optional for further visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (for future visualization expansion)

## ✅ How to Use
